Welcome to my _new blog_ about lerning Astro! Here i will share my progress building my blog.

## What I've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, installed Node.js and then created a new Astro project and connected it to Github & Netlify.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learnt how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post made using a Markdown file.

## What's Next?

I will finish the tutorial and keep adding more posts.
